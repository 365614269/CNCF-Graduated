## 101 persona 
Content for anyone interested in cloud native concepts but with little to no previous tech knowledge. From the CEO who's suddenly in regular meetings with their CIO to discuss a migration of mission critical systems to a cloud native architecture to the new marketing or sales rep joining a cloud native startup who needs to get up to speed. 

At this stage, they all just need to understand what the tech is and what role it plays in the ecosystem. Due to their lack of previous knowledge, they'll benefit from examples that make these abstract tech concepts more concrete (e.g. machine >> your laptop, orchestrator >> OS, network >> the internet, scalability >> Netflix each Friday evening).
