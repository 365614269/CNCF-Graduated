## Harbor Team is Heading to KubeCon!

We're excited to share that we'll be at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2018 in
Seattle next week!  Since KubeCon at Copenhagen (which many of us went to,
though not representing any particular CNCF project) we've been hard at work
at improving Harbor by working closely with the community to understand their
needs and wants.

Today Harbor is
a [healthy](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health?orgId=1) and
vibrant incubated project at the CNCF. We've seen growth in our community and
superb contributions in the form of issues, code, and project feedback.

Our global team is arriving in Seattle over the weekend and is excited to
engage with users, prospective users, and even those who are just curious
to learn more about Harbor and what it does. We'll be wearing Harbor t-shirts
throughout the conference, so if you see one of us please don't be shy and say
hello!

There are a few scheduled events / places to find us:

* **Meet the Maintainer Booth** - find us at the CNCF Meet the Maintainer
Booth on Tuesday from 2:00-3:30pm, Wednesday from 2:00-2:30pm, and Thursday
from 10:30AM-11:30AM.
* **Harbor 101** - Henry Zhou, founder of Harbor, and James Zabala, lead
maintainer, will be presenting a 101-level presentation that discusses the
why and hows of Harbor. If you want a 15,000 ft view of the container registry
project and how it might fit in your organization, this is the presentation
for you.
* **Harbor Deep Dive** - Daniel Jiang and Steven Zou, both senior technical
architects of the project, will be discussing how things tick under the hood.
Want to learn about the core service, job service, or how we proxy Docker
`push` and `pull` requests to ensure RBAC and vulnerability scan results are
within policy? This is the session for you.
* **VMware Booth** - Daniel Jiang, senior technical lead, will be at the
VMware booth on Tuesday at 2:00pm.

We couldn't be more excited to join the community at this fun event and
finally meet many of you in person. On a personal level, these events are
really what make open source special: meeting those with whom you work on
GitHub and Slack every day and discussing how to improve things moving
forward in real life.

By the way, mention this blog post and grab a free Harbor t-shirt at any one
of the events listed above!
