As of today Harbor is a [healthy](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health?orgId=1) and
vibrant Graduated project at the CNCF. We've seen growth in our community and
superb contributions in the form of issues, code, and project feedback.

and looking forward to engage with users, prospective users, and those who are just curious
to learn more about Harbor and what it does. We'll be wearing Harbor t-shirts
throughout the conference, so if you see one of us please don't be shy and say
hello!

really what make open source special: meeting those with whom you work on
GitHub and Slack every day and discussing how to improve things moving
forward IRL.
