We hope you didn't land on our page by accident so you know what Project Harbor is. The interesting part of the project is the diversity and all the great folks and companies being part of it you can check all that on the [Harbor's DevStats Page by CNCF](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health?orgId=1).

In September, the Harbor team and CNCF also released the [Harbor Journey Report](https://www.cncf.io/reports/harbor-project-journey-report/) to get more insides how the project evolved over the last few years, get some names who is behind the project, and how you can join us and make even better!


[Yan Wang](https://twitter.com/wy65701436), [Vadim Bauer](https://twitter.com/vad1mo) and [Orlin Vasilev](https://twitter.com/OrlinVasilev) will be in Chicago of the week of 6th of November(and before that on Rejects)
and looking forward to engaging with users, contributors, maintainers, and those who are just curious
to learn more about Harbor and what it does. We'll be wearing Harbor t-shirts(a special Harbor t-shirt)
throughout the conference, so if you see one of us please don't be shy and say
hello, and you can get the same T-shirt!
