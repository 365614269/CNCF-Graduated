We've been hard at work on our new Harbor site, and we're thrilled to finally
open it up to the world!

For those unfamiliar with Harbor, it is an open source cloud native registry
with a focus on storing, scanning and securing content. Born out of a need for
such a project at VMware, the registry's roadmap and feature velocity is
influenced by our community of users and developers.

As time progresses we'll move most of the docs on our GitHub wiki to this
site. Of course, our source code and even the source for this website will
continue to live on GitHub and we welcome contributions of any kind.

Looking forward to seeing how Harbor grows as we continue on this open source
journey.

Harbor Team
