As of today, Harbor is a [healthy](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health?orgId=1) and
vibrant graduate project at the CNCF. We've seen growth in our community and
superb contributions in the form of issues, code, and project feedback.

and looking forward to engaging with users, and those who are just curious
