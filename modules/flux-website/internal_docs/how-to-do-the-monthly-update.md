# Writing the monthly update

For us as the Flux project, it's important we explain well what has
been going on in our space, in all the aspects: development, community,
documentation, ecosystem, events and everything else.

We have been informing our community on <https://fluxcd.io/blog/> and
other channels since December 2020.

## Preparing the update

To start a new entry, you simply run

```cli
./hack/new-update-post.py
```

It's a good idea to commit it and push it to a draft PR early on,
so everybody gets a chance to put in all the required information
for release on e.g. the first of the month.

Ping the relevant teams and spokespeople so they get in their update.
The individual sections have grown over time and we can change them
if we want. Just update `templates/monthly-update.md` for that.

## Spreading the news

The communications plan we usually use can be seen here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPV3qJ95I_RKPyeo3zUJOPrHc0LNeSlP3f9fjXTen-c/edit#gid=0>.
It lists the blog posts and the individual places where we broadcast
the information afterwards, e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, our mailing list,
the CNCF blog and elsewhere, just to be sure everyone sees it.
