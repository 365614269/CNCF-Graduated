# Contributing

Flux is [Apache 2.0 licensed](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/blob/main/LICENSE) and
accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines
some of the conventions on to make it easier to get your contribution
accepted.

We gratefully welcome improvements to issues and documentation as well as to
code.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution.

We require all commits to be signed. By signing off with your signature, you
certify that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the
material by the rules of the [DCO](DCO):

`Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>`

The signature must contain your real name
(sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions)
If your `user.name` and `user.email` are configured in your Git config,
you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

### Format of the Commit Message

For this repository we prefer the following rules for good commit messages:

- Limit the subject to 50 characters and write as the continuation
  of the sentence "If applied, this commit will ..."
- Explain what and why in the body, if more than a trivial change;
  wrap it at 72 characters.

The [following article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
has some more helpful advice on documenting your work.
