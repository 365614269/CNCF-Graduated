So you and your organisation are using Flux? That's great. We would love to hear from you! ðŸ’–

## Adding yourself

Each YAML file in [this directory](https://github.com/fluxcd/website/tree/main/data/adopters) lists the organisations who adopted the specific project in production. So if you use

- Flux or the GitOps Toolkit controllers, you are looking for `1-flux-v2.yaml`
- Flagger, it's `2-flagger.yaml`
- Flux (legacy) or Helm Operator, take a look at `3-flux-v1.yaml`  
  *Note:* Flux Legacy and Helm Operator have reached their EOL and have been archived.

You just need to add an entry for your company and upon merging it will automatically be added to our website.

To add your organisation follow these steps:

1. Fork the [fluxcd/website](https://github.com/fluxcd/website) repository.
1. Clone it locally with `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/website.git`.
1. (Optional) Add the logo of your organisation to `static/img/logos`. Good practice is for the logo to be called e.g. `<company>.png`.
1. Find the right `data/adopters/<project>.yaml` file as indicated above.
1. Add an entry to the YAML file with the `name` of your organisation, `url` that links to its website, and the path to the `logo`. Example:

   ```yaml
       - name: Xenit
         url: https://xenit.se/
         logo: logos/xenit.png
   ```

   You can just add to the end of the file, we already sort alphabetically by name of organisation.
1. Save the file, then do `git add -A` and commit using `git commit -s -m "Add MY-ORG to adopters"` (commit signoff is required, see [DCO](https://fluxcd.io/contributing/#certificate-of-origin)).
1. Push the commit with `git push origin main`.
1. Open a Pull Request to [fluxcd/website](https://github.com/fluxcd/website) and a preview build will turn up.

Thanks a lot for being part of our community - we very much appreciate it!

### Addendum

`/static/img/logos/logo-generic.png` is a slightly modified Flux logo, it is used when no organisation logo is provided.
