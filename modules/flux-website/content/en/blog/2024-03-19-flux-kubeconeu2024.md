The CNCF graduated Flux project is proud to announce that it will receive
enhanced support from dedicated companies in 2024.
These organizations are committed to the ongoing maintenance
and development of Flux GitOps tools.
[At KubeCon EU 2024 in Paris, the Flux project has keynote highlights, sessions, and a booth.](https://fluxcd.io/kubecon/)

## Vendors and clouds are stepping up contributions

Major vendors are ramping up their ecosystem involvement in Flux moving forward.
[GitLab announced its continued support for Flux](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/03/05/the-continued-support-of-fluxcd-at-gitlab/) and working with partners.
In early 2023, GitLab integrated Flux with its agent for Kubernetes offering as the recommended GitOps solution.

Similarly, Flux continues to be the GitOps engine for cloud vendors such as Microsoft and AWS.
Lachie Evenson at Microsoft affirms that "Flux is the engine that powers several GitOps
experiences on Azure as well as in our customer’s environments' and that Microsoft
is committed to upstream contributions.

> Flux is the engine that powers several GitOps experiences on Azure
> as well as in our customer’s environments. We will continue to invest
> in Flux through upstream contributions for the long-term health and
> support of the project, and downstream partnerships to help customers
>
> Lachie Evenson, Principal PDM Manager – Cloud Native Ecosystem, Microsoft

Both Azure and AWS use Flux to streamline
Kubernetes cluster and application management, adopting GitOps principles
for enhanced automation, security, and reliability in cloud-native application
deployments for Azure Arc Kubernetes and EKS-Anywhere.

## New Enterprise adopters: Silva project, Cisco, Tchibo, and more

Flux’s significant benefits show in its widespread adoption by large-scale
enterprises across various sectors, including telecommunications and financial services.
The new Sylva project showcases [the critical role of Flux for its complex telecom cloud native environments](https://sylva-projects.gitlab.io/release-note/).
Sylva streamlines the management of Kubernetes workload clusters, specifically designed
to deploy Containerized Network Functions (CNF) provided by both external CNF vendors
and telecom operators' in-house services. As Orange VP of Software Engineering affirms,
Flux’s security, modularity, resilience, and community all contribute to how it is the GitOps framework of choice.

> We are really happy to observe new big tech shops bringing their support to Flux.
> It should give to everyone the confidence to keep committing and investing.
> The level of quality and security, and the modularity of Flux have been prime
> reasons for our decision to use it two years ago to automate the deployment
> and lifecycle management of network functions. Our Linux Foundation Sylva-based
> cloud native infrastructure relies on the strength and resilience of the Flux community.
> Flux’s technology and community make it the GitOps framework in our Telco networks.
>
> Philippe Ensarguet, VP Software Engineering, Orange

Other long-time Flux [adopters](https://fluxcd.io/adopters/) who have added themselves to the public
list recently include Cisco and German retailer, Tchibo.

## New Support and Ecosystem: Hirings and Value-Add Extensions

While several ecosystem companies are coordinating to step up as maintainers,
contributors, and supporters of Flux,
[ControlPlane was first to hire Stefan Prodan](https://control-plane.io/posts/controlplane-backs-the-cncf-flux-project-by-employing-maintainers/) (Flux project maintainer and architect as well as Flagger creator)
and Soulé Ba (core maintainer) to continue their contributions.
As ControlPlane CEO, Andrew Martin, has reinforced their commitment to help maintain the project,
which is part of their offering of an enterprise-grade distribution of Flux,
including support services for critical system.

> ControlPlane is delighted to continue supporting the Flux project for all users,
> and to provide organisations utilising Flux with access to a hardened,
> FIPS-compliant, enterprise-grade distribution of Flux.
>
> Andrew Martin, CEO, ControlPlane

In addition, companies such as Aviator, OpsMX, OpsWorks Group,
OSO and Teracloud began providing support for Flux among their offerings.

At KubeCon EU 2024 in Paris, these and other companies in the ecosystem
will meet at a [Birds of a Feather meeting](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1akzm?iframe=no)
to kick off further commitments
to add value to Flux’s extensibility and ecosystem reach.

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation Exemplar Project

At this juncture, the Flux project is a strong graduated project within the
Cloud Native Computing Foundation with continued recognition from CNCF CTO,
Chris Aniszczyk, who states how Flux exemplifies the strength and resilience of the community.
Flux reached General Availability in December 2023 and blew through its
second security audit with the CNCF with no CVEs.
The project’s published [benchmarks](https://fluxcd.io/blog/2023/12/flux-v2.2.0/#benchmark-results)
results demonstrate why cloud vendors
and enterprises alike have been trusting Flux with their needs for scale.

> I am glad to see the continued support across the open source cloud native community for Flux.
> I encourage other organizations to get involved as there's never a bad time to contribute
> to an open source project you depend on. Also, this is a great example of the strength
> and resilience of our community and we look forward to Flux's continued evolution and growth.
>
> Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF
