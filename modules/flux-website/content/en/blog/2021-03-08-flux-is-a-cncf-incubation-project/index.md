The Flux community is proud to announce that the CNCF Technical
Oversight Committee just promoted the Flux project to Incubating status!
ðŸŽ‰

For us as a project, this is proof not only of the wide-spread use of
Flux (and Helm Operator) v1, but also of our big strides into becoming a
GitOps family of projects and bringing a toolkit approach to Continuous
and Progressive Delivery.

We are particularly happy about the support from our community, the
project maintainers, contributors and end-users who helped us through
this process. Thanks to our friends at Deutsche Telekom, Lunar,
MediaMarktSaturn and Sortlist who spoke in favour of Flux and explained
their GitOps implementation in user interviews with the CNCF.

As a project we have come quite far in the last 5 years. From the time
when it was a Weaveworks-internal project to make simple deployments
happen to a buzzing and healthy project with maintainers from various
companies, hundreds of contributors and a regular release cycle. Thanks
a lot to [everyone who made Flux
possible](https://flux.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1)!

> validation of that community as much as the software itself."

## What's next for Flux

For 10 months we have been working on the new iteration of Flux. It is
based on modern tooling, very composable and we were able to add
long-requested features in next to no time.

Flux as a project has been on this trajectory for a longer time already:
Flux was started in 2016, the Helm Operator was added in 2018, kustomize
support added in 2019. 2020 was the year in which re-started the project
to turn Flux into a GitOps family of projects, where simple and focused
controllers can naturally be composed. 2021 saw Flagger being moved into
the Flux organization and will see the GA release of Flux v2 in the
coming months.

## Flux v2 getting closer to GA

We are very proud of where Flux v2 is at now, and are carefully working
toward a GA release, at which point we'll recommend that all Flux v1
users migrate to Flux v2.

Now is the perfect time to familiarise yourself with [Flux
v2](/) - the Get Started guide only takes a couple of minutes to complete.
If you prefer a video, check out [our resources section](/resources/).

Migrating from v1 will require some work, but it will definitely be
worth it: in this iteration you are going to get

- Support for multiple Git repositories
- Operational insight through health checks, events and alerts
- Multi-tenancy capabilities
- Better performance
- And lots of other new features

We've taken our time to ensure that Flux v2 has feature parity with Flux
v1, and that end users have the best experience possible migrating to
Flux v2. Stay tuned for our upcoming announcement about the Flux v2
migration and support timeline.
