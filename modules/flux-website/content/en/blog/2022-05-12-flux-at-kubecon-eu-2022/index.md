![KubeCon in Valencia](kubecon-featured.png)

We are so excited! [KubeCon / CloudNativeCon Europe
2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/)
is happening 16-20 May 2022 in Valencia, Spain. Team Flux is going to be
there and we are looking forward to meeting you in-person or in our
virtual sessions, meetings and co-located events. ðŸŽ‰

**Update:** 2022-05-16: We updated the details of the project meeting.

## If you can't make it to KubeCon

Many of us won't be able to attend in-person this time around. Don't
worry, we have you covered! There will be lots of opportunities to meet
Flux people online, see talks, discuss and learn from each other.

There's just one thing you need to do to join: visit our [Flux at
KubeCon site](https://bit.ly/flux_kubeconEU2022) and
bookmark it. It lists all the talks and all events - everything
Flux-related in one place.

![Flux Events page](flux-events.png)

We are also going to have a Virtual Booth. This will allow you to talk
to Flux people at all official booth times, we will have short talks,
watch some of the talks together and bring like-minded people together.
We can't wait to meet you there.

Visit our [Flux at KubeCon site](https://bit.ly/flux_kubeconEU2022)
and bookmark it now!

## ðŸŽ‰ Flex your Flux knowledge and win prizes! ðŸŽ‰

If you are at KubeCon, this is your chance to get a limited edition
T-shirt (while supplies last) and a chance to win a meeting with a Flux
or Flagger maintainer!

## At KubeCon, watch out for these folks

![Team Flux at KubeCon](team-flux-at-kubecon.png)

There will be lots more of Team Flux in the crowds: contributors,
advocates, friends, implementers and folks in adjacent communities we
work a lot with. Find them at our physical booth or in all of the
sessions listed below.

All right, how about these folks above? They will all give sessions, MC
the events and coordinate all the things.

- **Priyanka "Pinky" Ravi** has been speaking about her experience as
   a DevOps Engineer a lot lately. She gathered a lot of experience
   working at a large insurance institution and helped them
   transition to Flux and GitOps. Since then she has been a recurring
   guest at Weave Online User Group, [GitOps
   Days](https://www.gitopsdays.com/) and elsewhere.
- **Stefan Prodan** is the creator of Flagger and has been a core
   maintainer of Flux since Weaveworks donated the project to CNCF.
   He is a maintainer of SMI and he\'s been part of Team Flux for 4+
   years already. He is also the owner of a very cute dog.
- **Scott Rigby** is a maintainer of Flux and Helm, and one of the
   chairs of OpenGitOps. He knows the ecosystem very well,
   contributed a lot to all these projects and was one of the driving
   forces behind Flux Governance.
- **Philips Laine** is a core maintainer of Flux as well and among
   other things founded the terraform-provider-flux project.
- **Vanessa Abankwah** is pulling all the strings behind the scenes.
   Not only did she organise all of our presence at KubeCon, but lots
   and lots of meetups and events where Team Flux was present.
- **Max Jonas Werner** is a core maintainer of Flux as well and makes
   sure that Flux works great in D2iQ's DKP platform. Apart from that
   he is interested in landing OCI support in Flux and loads more.

Everyone is looking forward to meeting you! ðŸ’–
