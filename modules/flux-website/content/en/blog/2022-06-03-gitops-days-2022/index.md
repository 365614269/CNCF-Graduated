The Flux Community is proud to play a central part in the upcoming
GitOps Days event. In a free two-day event we will join in and all learn
from Flux maintainers, adopter use-cases, end-user stories and
integrators who use Flux to power their GitOps offerings.

The event is a testament to what we as a community have accomplished
together, how GitOps as a best-practise has evolved and to the general
growth of the ecosystem.

We hope you will join us, as the event is a lot of fun, a great way to
get to know people and get inspired.

**GitOps Days 2022 is a free 2-day online event on June 8-9, 2022.**
