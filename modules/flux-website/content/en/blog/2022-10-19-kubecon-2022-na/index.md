Everybody in Team Flux is busy with [the run-up to Flux
GA](/roadmap/#the-road-to-flux-v2-ga), but -- with the help of
the great folks in our Community and Ecosystem -- we also
managed to put together quite a number of talks, tutorials and sessions
for you at KubeCon / CloudNativeCon!

We are happy to announce that we will be at GitOpsCon and KubeCon.

We are only a few days away from the event and we look forward to
meeting you there, or seeing you in the online sessions! Meet us at our
booth in-person at the Project Pavilion during KubeCon, see demos, ask
questions and get involved in our community!

To make this all easier, we put together this mini-site for you: [Flux
@ KubeCon mini site](https://bit.ly/flux-kubecon-2022). Go
ahead and bookmark it now - there you have all the Flux things in one
place.
