May was packed with exciting stories from Flux users, newly updated
Flux adopters, contributors, contributions and a new GA release candidate!
Also, don‚Äôt miss future Flux Bug Scrubs using ChatGPT.

## Flux technology things to know

### Three more Flux release candidates! Many improvements - Please test

On our path to GA, we released [v2.0.0-rc5](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.5),
the fifth release candidate for the 2.0.0 release. It includes many fixes,
so you are very much encouraged to upgrade to this latest version - even though
it carries "RC" in its version number, it is the most stable Flux release to date.
Users are advised to upgrade from v0.41 and older versions to v2.0.0-rc.5 as soon as possible.

#### Fixes and improvements

- Starting with this version, source-controller, kustomize-controller and
  helm-controller pods are marked as
  [system-cluster-critical](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/).
- The `Alert` v1beta2 API has two new optional fields. `.spec.inclusionList` for
  fine-grained control over events filtering (notification-controller) and 
  `.spec.metadata` that allows users to enrich the alerts with information 
  about the cluster name, region, environment, etc.
- New command `flux reconcile source chart` for pulling Helm OCI charts on-demand
  from container registries (CLI).
- Support annotated Git tags with .spec.ref.name in GitRepository (source-controller).
- The deprecated field `.status.url` was removed from the `Receiver` v1
  API (notification-controller).
- Add support for commit signing using OpenPGP keys with
  passphrases (image-automation-controller).
- Fix bootstrap for BitBucket Server (CLI).
- Fix secrets decryption when using Azure Key Vault (kustomize-controller).
- Fix drift detection for renamed HelmReleases (helm-controller).
- Improve performance when handling webhook receivers (notification-controller).
- Improve the detection of values changes for HelmReleases by stable 
  sorting them by key (helm-controller)
- Update cosign to v2 (source-controller)
- Support for Helm 3.12.0 and Kustomize v5.0.3.

To upgrade from v0.x to v2.0.0-rc.5, please see
[the procedure documented in RC.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

:warning: Note that Kubernetes 1.27.0 contains a regression bug that affects
Flux, it is recommended to upgrade Kubernetes to 1.27.1 or newer. The upgrade to
Kustomize v5 also contains breaking changes, please consult their
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.0.0) for more details.

Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!

### Security news

All components have been updated to patch vulnerabilities in Docker (CVE-2023-28840,
CVE-2023-28841, CVE-2023-28842) and Sigstore (CVE-2023-30551, CVE-2023-33199).

### Flagger 1.31.0

This release adds support for Linkerd 2.13. Furthermore, a bug which led the confirm-rollout
webhook to be executed at every step of the Canary instead of only being executed before the
canary deployment is scaled up, has been fixed.

:warning: This release contains some breaking changes for the Linkerd integration.
Please see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1310)
on how to upgrade.

capacity, just show up or if you have questions, reach out to Kingdon on
Slack.*

## Flux Fun Fact!

Did you know ‚Ä¶ 
üî© Flux works with your existing tools: Flux works with your Git providers
(GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use s3-compatible buckets as a source),
all major container registries, and all CI workflow providers. GitLab also
announced that Flux is their GitOps tool of choice, so you'll see even more
synergy this year!

## Over and out

- Join our [upcoming dev meetings](https://fluxcd.io/community/#meetings).
