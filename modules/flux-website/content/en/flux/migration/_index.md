Flux Legacy and Helm Operator have [been
archived](/blog/2022/10/september-2022-update/#flux-legacy-v1-retirement-plan). This means that development and support by the Flux Community has been stopped indefinitely.

We strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with the newest Flux and migrate as soon as possible.

If you still need migration help, there are still [free migration
workshops](https://bit.ly/FluxMigrationSurvey), or reach out for paid
support to one of the companies [listed here](/support/#commercial-support).
