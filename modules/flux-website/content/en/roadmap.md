# Flux Roadmap

{{% alert color="info" title="Production readiness" %}}
The Flux latest [beta and stable APIs](/flux/components/)
(including their reconcilers) are well tested and safe to use in production environments.
The beta APIs will be replaced in time with stable versions.

To learn more about Flux supported versions and release cadence,
please see the [Flux release process](/flux/releases/).

## Milestones

The Flux project roadmap is divided into milestones representing minor releases,
each with a set of goals and tasks. The milestones marked as **provisional** are
subject to change based on the project's priorities and the community's feedback.

Please note that the Flux maintainers prioritize fixes to defects affecting GA APIs
and security issues over new features. Depending on the volume of incoming issues and
the complexity of the fixes, the roadmap may be adjusted and new features
may be postponed to the next milestone.
