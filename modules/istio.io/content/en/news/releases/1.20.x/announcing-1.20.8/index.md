## Changes

- **Added** `gateways.securityContext` to manifests to provide an option to customize the gateway `securityContext`.

- **Fixed** an issue where JWKS fetched from URIs were not updated promptly when there are errors fetching other URIs.
  ([Issue #51636](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51636))

- **Fixed** 503 errors returned by `auto-passthrough` gateways created after enabling mTLS.

- **Fixed** `serviceRegistry` ordering of the proxy labels, so we put the Kubernetes registry in front.
