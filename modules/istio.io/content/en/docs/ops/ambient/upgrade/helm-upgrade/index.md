Follow this guide to upgrade and configure ambient mesh using
[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/).  This guide assumes you have already performed an ambient mesh
[installation with Helm](/docs/ops/ambient/install/helm-installation/) with a previous minor or patch version of Istio.

{{< boilerplate ambient-alpha-warning >}}

{{< warning >}}
In contrast to sidecar mode, `Ambient` supports moving application pods to an upgraded data plane without a mandatory restart or reschedule of running application pods. However, upgrading the data plane **will** briefly disrupt all workload traffic on the upgraded node, and ambient does not currently support canary upgrades of the data plane.

Node cordoning and blue/green node pools are recommended to control blast radius of application pod traffic disruption during production upgrades. See your Kubernetes provider documentation for details.
{{< /warning >}}

## Prerequisites

1. Install ambient mesh with Helm by following [Install with Helm](/docs/ops/ambient/install/helm-installation/) and meeting all prerequisites in that guide.

1. Update the Helm repository:

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=update_helm >}}
    $ helm repo update istio
    {{< /text >}}

## In-place upgrade

You can perform an in place upgrade of Istio in your cluster using the Helm
upgrade workflow.

Before upgrading Istio, it is recommended to run the `istioctl x precheck` command to make sure the upgrade is compatible with your environment.

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=istioctl_precheck >}}
$ istioctl x precheck
âœ” No issues found when checking the cluster. Istio is safe to install or upgrade!
  To get started, check out <https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/>

{{< warning >}}
[Helm does not upgrade or delete CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations) when performing an upgrade. Because of this restriction, an additional step is required when upgrading Istio with Helm.
{{< /warning >}}

### Manually upgrade the CRDs and Istio base chart

1. Upgrade the Kubernetes custom resource definitions ({{< gloss >}}CRDs{{</ gloss >}}):

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=manual_crd_upgrade >}}
    $ kubectl apply -f manifests/charts/base/crds
    {{< /text >}}

1. Upgrade the Istio base chart:

    {{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_base >}}
    $ helm upgrade istio-base manifests/charts/base -n istio-system --skip-crds
    {{< /text >}}

### Upgrade the Istio discovery Component

Istiod is the control plane component that manages and configures the proxies to route traffic within the ambient mesh.

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_istiod >}}
$ helm upgrade istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

### Upgrade the ztunnel component

The ztunnel DaemonSet is the L4 node-proxy component of ambient.

{{< warning >}}
Upgrading ztunnel in-place will briefly disrupt all ambient mesh traffic on the node.
Node cordoning and blue/green node pools are recommended to mitigate blast radius risk during production upgrades. See your Kubernetes provider documentation for details.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_ztunnel >}}
$ helm upgrade ztunnel istio/ztunnel -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

### Upgrade the CNI Component

The Istio CNI agent is responsible for detecting the pods that belong to the ambient mesh, and configuring the traffic redirection between pods and the ztunnel DaemonSet. It is not part of the data plane or control plane.

The Istio CNI agent at version 1.x is compatible with control plane at version 1.x-1, 1.x, and 1.x+1, which means the Istio CNI agent and the Istio control plane can be upgraded independently and in any order, as long as their version difference is within one minor version.

{{< warning >}}
Upgrading the Istio CNI agent will reconfigure networking on the node, and as such will momentarily disrupt node traffic. To manage blast radius to application pods during Istio CNI agent upgrade, node cordons are recommended.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_cni >}}
$ helm upgrade istio-cni istio/cni -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

### (Optional) Upgrade the Gateway component

Gateway components manage east-west and north-south dataplane traffic between ambient mesh boundaries, as well as some aspects of the L7 dataplane.

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=upgrade_gateway >}}
$ helm upgrade istio-ingress istio/gateway -n istio-ingress
{{< /text >}}

## Configuration

To view supported configuration options and documentation, run:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=show_istiod_values >}}
$ helm show values istio/istiod
{{< /text >}}

## Verify the Installation

### Verify the workload status

After installing all the components, you can check the Helm deployment status with:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=show_components >}}
$ helm list -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

You can check the status of the deployed Istio pods with:

{{< text syntax=bash snip_id=check_pods >}}
$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system
{{< /text >}}

## Uninstall

Please refer to the uninstall section in our [Helm ambient install guide](/docs/ops/ambient/install/helm-installation/#uninstall).
