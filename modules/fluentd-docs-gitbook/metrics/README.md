# Metrics Plugins

Fluentd has nine \(9\) types of plugins:

* [Input](../input/)
* [Parser](../parser/)
* [Filter](../filter/)
* [Output](../output/)
* [Formatter](../formatter/)
* [Storage](../storage)
* [Service Discovery](../service_discovery/)
* [Buffer](../buffer/)
* [Metrics](./)

This article gives an overview of Metrics Plugin.

## Overview

Sometimes, the input/filter/output plugin needs to save its internal metrics in memory, influxdb or prometheus format ready in instances. Fluentd has a pluggable system called Metrics that lets a plugin store and reuse its internal state as metrics instances.

## How To Use

On Fluentd core, metrics plugin will handled on `<metrics>` on `<system>` to set up easily.

Here is an example with `metrics_local`:

```text
<system>
  <metrics>
    @type local
  </metrics>
</system>
```

`local` type plugin should provide equivalent behavior before Fluentd v1.13.
This metrics type should provide single numeric value storing functionality.

And this `local` type plugin should be used by default.

## List of Built-in Metrics Plugins

* [`local`](local.md)

## List of Base Plugin classes with Metrics support
