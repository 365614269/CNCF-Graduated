# Send Apache Logs to S3

This article explains how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)'s Amazon S3 Output plugin \([`out_s3`](../output/s3.md)\) to aggregate semi-structured logs in realtime.

## Background

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) is an advanced open-source log collector originally developed at [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/). One of the main objectives of log aggregation is data archiving. [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), the cloud object storage provided by Amazon, is a popular solution for data archiving.

This article will show you how to use [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) to import Apache logs into Amazon S3.

## Mechanism

Fluentd does three \(3\) things:

1. It continuously "tails" the access log file.
2. It parses the incoming log entries into meaningful fields \(such as `ip`,

   `path`, etc.\) and buffers them.

3. It writes the buffered data to Amazon S3 periodically.

## Install

For simplicity, this article will describe how to set up a one-node configuration. Please install the following software on the same node:

* [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/)
* [Amazon S3 Output Plugin](../output/s3.md)
* Your Amazon Web Services Account
* Apache \(with the Combined Log Format\)

The Amazon S3 Output plugin is included in the latest version of Fluentd's deb/rpm package. If you want to use RubyGems to install the plugin, please use `gem install fluent-plugin-s3`.

* [Debian Package](../installation/install-by-deb.md)
* [RPM Package](../installation/install-by-rpm.md)
* [Ruby gem](../installation/install-by-gem.md)

## Configuration

Let's start configuring Fluentd. If you used the deb/rpm package, Fluentd's config file is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`. Otherwise, it is located at `/etc/fluentd/fluentd.conf`.

### Tail Input

For the input source, we will set up Fluentd to track the recent Apache logs \(typically found at `/var/log/apache2/access_log`\). The Fluentd configuration file should look like this:

```text
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/apache2/access_log
  pos_file /var/log/td-agent/apache2.access_log.pos
  <parse>
    @type apache2
  </parse>
  tag s3.apache.access
</source>
```

Please make sure that your Apache outputs are in the default **combined** format. `format apache2` cannot parse custom log formats. Please see the [`in_tail`](../input/tail.md) article for more information.

Let's go through the configuration line by line:

1. `type tail`: The tail Input plugin continuously tracks the log file.

   This handy plugin is included in Fluentd's core.

2. `@type apache2` in `<parse>`: Uses Fluentd's built-in Apache log parser.
3. `path /var/log/apache2/access_log`: The location of the Apache log.

   This may be different for your particular system.

4. `tag s3.apache.access`: `s3.apache.access` is used as the tag to route the

   messages within Fluentd.

That's it! You should now be able to output a JSON-formatted data stream for Fluentd to process.

### Amazon S3 Output

The output destination will be Amazon S3. The output configuration should look like this:

```text
<match s3.*.*>
  @type s3

  aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID
  aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET/KEY
  s3_bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
  path logs/

  <buffer>
    @type file
    path /var/log/td-agent/s3
    timekey 3600  # 1 hour
    timekey_wait 10m
    chunk_limit_size 256m
  </buffer>

  time_slice_format %Y%m%d%H
</match>
```

The match section specifies the regexp used to look for matching tags. If a matching tag is found in a log, then the config inside `<match>...</match>` is used \(i.e. the log is routed according to the config inside\). In this example, the `s3.apache.access` tag \(generated by `tail`\) is always used.

## Test

To test the configuration, just ping the Apache server. This example uses the `ab` \(Apache Bench\) program:

```text
$ ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost/
```

Then, log into your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) and look at your bucket.

WARNING: By default, files are created on an hourly basis \(around xx:10\). This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no file is created immediately. The file will be created when the `timekey` condition has been met. To change the output frequency, please modify the `timekey` value. To write objects every minute, please use `timekey 60` with smaller `timekey_wait` like `timekey_wait 10s`.

## Conclusion

Fluentd + Amazon S3 makes real-time log archiving simple.
