# Install by Ruby Gem

This article explains how to install Fluentd using Ruby `gem`.

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Pre-installation Guide](before-install.md) to configure your OS properly.

## Step 1: Install Ruby Interpreter

Install Ruby `>= 2.4` on your local environment. In addition, install `ruby-dev` package via Package Manager to build native extension gems.

## Step 2: Install Fluentd Gem

Fetch and install the `fluentd` Ruby gem using `gem` command:

```text
$ gem install fluentd --no-doc
```

The official RubyGems page is [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/fluentd).

## Step 3: Run

Run the following commands to verify the Fluentd installation:

```text
$ fluentd --setup ./fluent
$ fluentd -c ./fluent/fluent.conf -vv &
$ echo '{"json":"message"}' | fluent-cat debug.test
```

The second command starts Fluentd as a daemon. If you want to stop its daemon, you can use `$ pkill -f fluentd`. The last command sends Fluentd a message '{"json":"message"}' with a `debug.test` tag. If the installation is successful, Fluentd will output the following message:

```text
2011-07-10 16:49:50 +0900 debug.test: {"json":"message"}
```

It is highly recommended to set up `ntpd` on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs.

For large deployments, you must use [`jemalloc`](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/) to avoid memory fragmentation. This is already included in the [`rpm`](install-by-rpm.md) and [`deb`](install-by-deb.md) packages.

The Fluentd gem does not come with `/etc/init.d/` scripts. You should use Process Management tools such as:

* [`daemontools`](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)
* [`runit`](http://smarden.org/runit/)
* [`supervisord`](http://supervisord.org/)
* [`upstart`](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/)
* `systemd`

## Next Steps

You are now ready to collect real logs with Fluentd. Refer to the following tutorials on how to collect data from various sources:
